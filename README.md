  - Generate a unique restaurant name.

  - Generate a corresponding menu for that restaurant.

- Saves generated restaurants and menus in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

- Provides API endpoints to create restaurants and retrieve history of generated restaurants.

- Includes CORS middleware to support frontend apps hosted on different domains.

- Simple frontend integration example that sends user input to backend and displays generated restaurant info.

## Setup With Docker

1. Install Docker On Your Machine

2. Clone the repository (if you havenâ€™t already):

git clone https://github.com/CodesByNeeraj/restaurantfastapi.git
cd <your-repo-folder>

3. Build the Docker image:

docker build -t langchain-restaurant-app .

langchain-restaurant-app is the image name; you can choose any name you prefer.

4. Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8000:8000 langchain-restaurant-app

This runs the container and maps port 8000 inside the container to port 8000 on your machine.
